<h1><i>Challenged, burdened, and crushed.</i></h1> 

<hr>

<p>I am the eldest grandchild on my mother's side and the 24th grandchild on my father's.</p> 

<p>As I grew, life has challenged my limits: family challenges my endurance, school challenges my knowledge, friends challenge my creativity, and love challenges my patience.</p>

<hr>

<p>No matter the challenge. Failure is not a choice or result; it is a warning I heed.</p>

<p>-My endurance, even when exhausted, I still push on.</p>
<p>-My knowledge, while adequate, I still learn.</p>
<p>-My creativity, while impressive, I still improving.</p>
<p>-My patience, while idle, I still hope.</p> 

<hr>

<p>As I grew, expectations were placed on my shoulder to be successful.</p>

<p>"Do well in school."</p>
<p>"Get a great job."</p>
<p>"We want you to be successful."</p>

<hr>

<p>I know I am not perfect; no one is. So instead of achieving perfection, I choose to hone my planning skills. After all, while everyone tries to swim against the river, I am at the side walking along the banks.</p>

<p>Thinking smart has helped me accomplish some achievements in my life.</p> 

<p>1.	Get first in a science competition.</p>
<p>2.	Be part of my school's national debate team.</p>
<p>3.	Join theater arts.</p>
<p>4.	Shortlisted for Young Writers Program: Open Mic Night</p>
<p>5.	Had a girlfriend</p>
<p>6.	Publish some story (Walf_Albot (@Walf_Albot) - Wattpad)</p>
<p>7.	Started a YT Channel (@Wal_Were)</p>

<p>I am a simple person. If my parents want me to succeed, then I will. Anything else is a personal goal of mine.</p>

<p>•	Get married one day</p>
<p>•	Have kids</p>
<p>•	Have enough money so I can spend it leisurely</p>
<p>•	On progress</p>

<p>Guess that is all I need to share. Remember, think smart, not hard.</p>
